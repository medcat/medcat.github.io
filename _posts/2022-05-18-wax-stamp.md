  I have been given too much power (a new resin 3d printer) and decide the new
  best thing to do with it is - get this - to 3d print wax sealing stamps.
  Because I know exactly what I'm doing.

For the actual stamp process, skip to [here](#designing-the-block).

## The Problem

I am woefully under equipped.  I lack the warm embrace of some sort of...
machine... that allows me complete, unbridled, access, to anything I could
potentially imagine.  I lack the ability to create something physical.

I lack a 3d printer.  My previous one, that I had... _cough_... inherited (long
story, honestly), is a piece of crap.  It was an FDM[^1] printer, but
as far as I can tell, the model had long since been abandoned (despite being
essentially a 1-to-1 copy of another 3d printer, just with unknown hardware
changes (apparently, the company doesn't want to share; I wonder why), and
different firmware), with no recent firmware updates; and, unfortunately for me,
had a failed proximity sensor in the head - resulting in the (active _and
heated_) nozzle embedding itself into the sticker material on the bed.
That... kinda sucked.

I wanted to produce things with fine details anyway, however, and FDM printers
aren't really known for their fine details; FDM printers are good at printing
big, fancy things, like vases, casts, or small boats.  But most of the stuff I
would be printing require fine details, since I'd be wanting to work on small
things anyway.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/3dbenchy.jpg" alt="A small, 3d printed boat, with primarily a blue color for the housing, and a red trim. The print is a bit rough, with obvious layer lines and small bits of plastic sticking places.">

    a boat model used for testing 3d printers.  You can see the layer lines
    here; while not all FDM printers produce layer lines this pronounced, it is
    hard to get fine details with FDM printers.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## The Solution

I bought a resin printer.

I've made worse decisions, honestly.  In this particular case, the finances
lined up quite nicely, as I had been given a gift of money in the exact amount
required for the printer.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/printer.jpg" alt="A resin printer, sitting atop a wooden table, with the red, translucent lid on; it's placed between a power brick and another device with a yellow, translucent lid.">
  <figcaption>
    The now-acquired resin printer.  It's already seen some (ab)use, but I am
    very pleased with it so far; it's at least lasted longer than my previous
    printer by a long shot.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The actual description for a resin printer is SLA[^2], and there is plenty of
content on the internet to describe what it is and how it works already - so
here's a brief summary.

Instead of melting plastic by layer into shapes on to a bed, we'll selectively
expose a photopolymer layer by layer to UV light, slowly pulling out the print
as it progresses, eventually resulting in the print we want.  This photopolymer
is our resin - the resin liquid sits in a bed atop (in our case) an LCD screen
(apparently, there is a variant that uses a UV laser instead, and that can get
more precise corners due to less aliasing); images will be displayed on this
LCD screen in the shape of the prints, and everywhere not blocked will be cured
by the intense UV.  At the start, the plate is 0.05mm away from the bed of the
tank; as each layer is successively cured, the cured resin is pulled away from
the bed, and up, into the plate[^3].

This makes it Really Nice for printing things with _very fine details_, but not
that great for printing large objects.  The upside is that print time is
completely linear with the number of layers.  The downside is that print time is
completely linear with the number of layers.  That means a tall, thin object
will take the same amount of time as a tall, fat object, which takes more than
double[citation needed] the time as a short object[^4].

This can be frustrating when you have to take a 6 hour print, only to find out
at the very end that the print failed; or, the part was incorrect; or, some
other reason why you might have to restart.  Because it is _incredibly
difficult_ to tell if/when a part has failed mid-print - something that FDM
printers have up on SLA printers.  _Sometimes_ you can tell, based on the sound
that the printer is making when it's lifting the print up; or, if the print is
tall enough, you can see it from outside the plastic cover.

Anyway, now I have a 3d printer.  Now I have to determine what to make with it.

## Finding Things To Print; Or, How Do I Use This Thing

Now, I have a resin printer.  It's a pretty nice looking resin printer, if I
do say so.  And while I definitely 100% did my research on how to use one of
these things (like any respectable consumer should do before purchasing
something), I've not actually learned the _process_[^5].

So obviously the first thing I did was print... _The Rook™_.  _The Rook™_ is
a file that was included with the printer that was, as the name implies, a
chess rook.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/rook.jpg" alt="Two chess rooks, with an intricate inner pattern instead of a body, consisting of a stair leading to the roof; they are placed on a grid surface.">
  <figcaption>
    The first print.  This was sliced by the manufacturer, using the provided
    resin, and turned out excellently.  And, since build times only increase with
    vertical layer count, and not horizontal complexity, printing two was free!
  </figcaption>
</figure>

This was (deceptively) easy.  Apart from having to manage the resin, and
cleaning the parts, and waiting for the print, I did not have to do _a thing_.
I don't know why everyone says this is difficult! ...that's mostly jest, of
course.

So... of course my next step is far more complex.  But first, a diversion!

### My Hobbies; Or, I Am A Nerd

I have many hobbies.  To note, I enjoy playing NeosVR with quite a few of my
friends.  To note, I have a... minor interest in stationery (I _swear_ it's
minor.  Don't ask me about my fountain pen collection.  Or ink collection.  Or
paper.)

So, on the first front, I happened to collect a 3D model of a friend's avatar.
(There's a story there.  I'm not going to tell it, but there is a story there.)
On the second front...

I'd, at the time, been intrigued by wax seal stamps.  The metal pieces,
engraved with a design, that is pressed into molten wax (of a specific type,
mind) in order to cause a design on the envelope.

<figure id="wait-what">
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/120stamp.jpg" style="max-height: 24rem" alt="A blob of wax that had a specific design imprinted into it.">
  <figcaption markdown="span">
    The end result, sort of.  Hey, did you know that the color of the wax used
    here originally meant something?[^6]  How neat.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Now, I don't actually know much/have much experience in this field.  But! But...
this seemed like something easy to dabble in.  I just had to make a block with
a design that would then be pressed into the wax.  It shouldn't be too
difficult, right?

### Designing the Block

I'll admit first hand that the initial design I used isn't my own.  The design
was borrowed from a game - [Outer Wilds][outer-wilds] (which is an excellent
game and a rabbit hole in and of itself)[^7].  So, one of my friends produced
the design for me, and after some editing and modelling... I stuck it on the
end of a large cylender, and 3D printed it.  Unfortunately, in my all-infinite
wisdom, I did not take pictures of the process.

### The First Print

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/firstPrint.jpg" alt="The 3D printer pictured earlier; however, this time, two prints are attached to the plate, upside down, which is still wet with resin.  The vat, still containing plentiful resin, is included below.">
  <figcaption>
    The end result of my first sliced print.  The slicer was set on the default settings
    which, well... made removal difficult.  I've since learned.  I've since learned...
  </figcaption>
</figure>

My first print was, by most metrics, a success.  Even with such a detailed print,
it came out nice, and the stamp... well, it printed well, at least.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/finalFirstPrint.jpg" alt="The same prints pictured as above, though this time right side up, up close, and... cleaned up.  The supports were... removed.">
  <figcaption>
    The end result.  The model on the left is the friend's model.  Yes, they are dabbing.
    Yes, they should be ashamed.  No, they are not sorry.  I did not do so well removing
    the supports here.  There is a minor defect in the face of the stamp on the right;
    however, the design came out pretty well.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

There are no obvious issues with it (apart from my exceedingly bad clean-up job
and support removal), and by most metrics it was a successful print.

It's just a shame the stamp didn't work.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/whatIsThatWhitePowderIDontRememberThat.jpg" alt="A series of attempts of sealing, on a few pieces of scrap paper, to test.  They all have varying issues with them, mostly that they were not complete.">
  <figcaption>
    Imagine having to try to clean gum out of your shoe.  Multiple times.  Because
    you keep stepping in it.  Over and over again.  Maybe don't.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Did I mention that I'm not particularly knowledgable about the topic of wax
stamps?  Yeah.  There are a few issues here, as far as I can tell, but even
on this I could be wrong[^8]:

- Most stamps are metal/brass.  I suspect that my resin here is a bit too
  rough, and so the wax has a higher binding affinity for my resin.  Not much
  I can do here, unless I get an engraving tool...[^9]
- My stamp is too deep.  I think I had initially gone with a depth of 1mm.  (I
  don't have the original file and my caliper sucks).  This made it easier for
  the wax to fill and stick to the stamp, and made it harder to counter this.
- The design was bad.  Well, not the design of the symbol, but of how it was
  cut into the stamp.  Instead of what I had, it should have been the
  negative of the design; less wax would get _into_ the stamp, and make it
  easier to remove.

So, I revised the design.  And I got confident.  I reduced the depth to 0.5mm.
I didn't invert the design just yet, though, because surely, if I reduced the
depth, it should be fine, right?

### The Next Print(s)

I printed 6 of this. It did not go better.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/whySix.jpg" alt="Six stamps, derived from the one pictured above.  This time it is placed on a wooden disk, on top of some machine.">
  <figcaption>
    The six stamps, freshly printed, in the curing station.  I'm pretty sure
    this is post-cure.  I don't know why I thought this was a good idea.  The
    lighting makes them look deeper than they actually are.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/whatDidYouExpect.jpg" alt="One of the above stamps on top of a piece of paper, on which two (failed) seals are placed.">
  <figcaption>
    The six stamps, freshly printed, in the curing station.  I'm pretty sure
    this is post-cure.  I don't know why I thought this was a good idea.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

At this point I was _a little bit_ frustrated.  I mean, it's totally expectable
in retrospect - _of course_ it wouldn't work.  But these things took _hours_ to
print - if I recall correctly, it was in the neighborhood of three to four
hours each, and I had done more than just these two prints by now.  So, I went
to eat, cooled off a bit, and tried again.  I got half way into my next print
when I realized there was an issue.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/neatButWrong.jpg" alt="The 3D printer, with a set of 3 prints.  The prints definitely do not look cylendrical, as specific layers of the print have been offset massively.">
  <figcaption>
    The issue.  It looks kinda neat, honestly.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

I'd... never seen this failure mode before.  It looks like layer separation
issues?  They somehow drifted?  Whatever it was, it was neat.  After discovering
the issue (points if you can guess the issue!)[^10] and fixing it, I finally
printed the full object instead:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/actuallyNeat.jpg" alt="The same machine as the six stamps picture, except this time, it has... six prints.  The three failed prints from the previous image, plus three new stamps.">
  <figcaption>
    The new, completed stamps, now fully inverted, and with a better depth.  And
    the cleaned up and cured failures from the previous print.  They were too...
    interesting, to not keep, honestly.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

After the intersting diversion of the failed print, here we are: the moment of
truth.  Would it stamp?  Well, first, a quick diversion.

### Hey, Maybe You Should Actually Do Research?

...after printing these, I did some research.  It turns out, wax can sometimes
stick to the stamp! Who would've known.  But... there are some ways to counter
this!  ...Who would've known!  Some suggestions I saw included:

- Putting the stamp into ice cold water before use.
- Coating the stamp front with a thin layer of oil, i.e. putting oil on a
  paper towel and rubbing the stamp into that.
- Using pre-produced wax seals, with adhesive on the back. (I can't do this,
  I want to use my own designs!)

So... in this run, I try this.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/IMG_1328.JPG" alt="Two of the above stamps, on a piece of paper, upon which one complete and full seal was made, and one incomplete or failed seal had been made.">
  <figcaption markdown="span">
    The seal on the left is the new result.  The design had been inverted here,
    but more importantly, a light coating of canola oil had been made onto the
    stamp, which made the process easier.  The seal on the left is the older
    design.  The difference is stark.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Finally, a mild form of success!  A seal that was... half decent.  Wait, could I
have done this the whole time?

[Yes.](/assets/wax-stamps/IMG_1335.JPG)  D'oh!  I didn't... really need to
change the depth... just the design and method of application...

Well, with that knowledge, I modified the design a bit.  I put a ring around
the edges to help catch some of the wax a bit. I increased the depth again.
(I added some quality-of-life features to the stamp itself[^11], including a
line along the side to show orientation, and a rounding along the base to make
it easier to remove from the platform).  And now, without further ado...

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/IMG_1355.JPG" alt="A wax seal, pressed firmly onto an envelope.  It includes the aforementioned design, with a circle around the symbol, and while the symbol is a bit rough around the edges, it is complete.">
  <figcaption>
    The final product.  Sort of.  Yes, it's a bit messy, but it had been my best
    seal yet.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Success! Mostly.  It's a marked improvement, I'll tell you that.  This is
something I'd feel comfortable putting on a letter and shipping across the
country.  Which I did do.  (It survived and made it to its destination
unharmed.  How's _that_ for sealing?)

Of course, it bugged me that I was borrowing someone else's design.  It couldn't
be used to represent _me_, and as we went over before, the symbol used should
mean something[^12]!  So I designed myself a new one:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/IMG_1359.JPG" alt="A stamp.  This time, it is solidly black, and has a completely new design on it.">
  <figcaption>
    The new design.  I sketched this out pretty quickly, and I'll probably use it
    for now.  Why not, after all?  I might adjust it in the future.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

[And promptly tested it out.](#wait-what)  It came out _perfectly_, I think.
I'll probably make some minor tweaks to it as it progresses, but overall I'm
proud of it.

## I Thought This Was About 3D Printing!

Oh yeah.  About that... well.  This project did allow me to get used to parts of
the process with printing! Honest!  Well, enough to feel confident to try to
take on something else...

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wax-stamps/ohGodWhy.jpg" alt="A new, unspecified 3D printed part; however, there are clearly issues with the part, where layers have separated.">
  <figcaption>
    Oh god why.

[^1]: Fused Deposition Modeling; this is what most people think of when they
      hear the term "3d printer."  There is a nozzle, that pushes out molten
      plastic, layer by layer, to create a 3d model.

[^2]: "Stereolithography."  Try saying that three times fast.

[^3]: This does mean that the bed of the tank needs to be made of a material
      that cured resin _will not_ stick to - this is the "FEP Release Film."
      (Apparently the "FEP" stands for "Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene.")  This
      does need to be replaced over time, as wear and tear (or scratches,
      punctures, or general damage) makes it fail more often, resulting in`
      failed prints.

[^4]: This does not apply for SLA printers that use a laser.  The laser has
      to sweep along the screen, which also takes time; so for laser SLA
      printers, it's also linear to the active portions of a layer.

[^5]: There is a distinction between "knowing something" and "knowing how to
      implement something," as any computer science student will tell you.  Some
      things _seem_ obvious when you talk about them _in general_.  Thankfully,
      my concerns about this exact situation was not unfounded here.

[^6]: Green was generally used for correspondance between friends, apparently.
      There's a whole rabbit hole here, it's seriously interesting - hell, even
      the _symbol used_ here should mean something! ...Though I don't know if
      it's really that important anymore.  [More info][seal-colors].

[^7]: If you're curious where the design is actually borrowed from, I'll note
      the answer by necessity has to be a spoiler.  With that in mind, <span class="spoiler" markdown="span">it
      comes from the design just above the door on the simulation connection
      building - specifically, the river lowlands building.</span>

[^8]: Corrections can always be sent to [blog@telios.dev][bat].  I don't claim
      to know these things, and I'm always interested in learning new things.
      Constructive criticism is welcome, destructive criticism can fuck right
      off.

[^9]: I have considered getting a small CNC router, or a lathe, but honestly,
      I don't know where I'd put it, and I worry I am far too unsafe to do so.
      Plus, those are tools in which you should really do research on how to use
      them (and which to get), before you get them, and I just... haven't.

[^10]: The answer: <span class="spoiler" markdown="span">the build plate wasn't
       firmly screwed down to the post, allowing it to move mid-print; thus,
       layers shifted and didn't always get removed from the FEP during printing.</span>

[^11]: One attempt that didn't make it into this post was when I tried adding a
       handle to the stamp, so I wouldn't have to print so much.  [It did not
       go well](/assets/wax-stamps/IMG_1337.jpg).

[^12]: It is known.
